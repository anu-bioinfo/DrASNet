# DrASNet
It is increasingly appreciated that alternative splicing plays a key role in generating functional specificity and diversity in cancer. However, the mechanisms by which cancer genomic aberrations perturb splicing remain unknown. Here, we developed a network-based strategy, DrAS-Net, to investigate over million variants across cancer types and link somatic mutations with cancer-specific splicing events. Our work reveals how single nucleotide changes can alter the repertoires of splicing isoforms, providing insights into oncogenic mechanisms for precision medicine.
